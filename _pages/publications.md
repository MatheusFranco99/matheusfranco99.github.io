> Traditional Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) state machine replication protocols assume a partial synchrony model, lead- ing to a design where a leader replica drives the protocol and is replaced after a timeout. Recently, we witnessed a surge of asynchronous BFT protocols, which use randomization to re- move the need for bounds on message delivery times, making them more resilient to adverse network conditions. However, existing research proposals still fall short of gaining practi- cal adoption, plausibly because they are not able to combine good performance with a simple design that can be readily understood and adopted. In this paper, we present Alea-BFT, a simple and highly efficient asynchronous BFT protocol, which is gaining practical adoption, namely in Ethereum dis- tributed validators. Alea-BFT brings the key design insight from classical protocols of concentrating part of the work on a single designated replica and incorporates this principle in a simple two-stage pipelined design, with an efficient broad- cast led by the designated replica, followed by an inexpensive binary agreement. The evaluation of our research prototype implementation and two real-world integrations in cryptocur- rency ecosystems shows excellent performance, improving on the fastest protocol (Dumbo-NG) in terms of latency and displaying good performance under faults.
