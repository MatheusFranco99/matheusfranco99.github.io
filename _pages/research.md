**An anonymous and performant gossip protocol - University of Lisbon, Instituto Superior Técnico / INESC-ID and SSV.Labs** \
*2024 - Present*
- Design of a gossip protocol that can balance high performance (in message delivery time) and
provable anonymity.
- Evaluation of the model against state-of-the-art protocols.
- In collaboration with **Rodrigo Rodrigues** and **Rachid Guerraoui**.


**Asynchronous BFT Consensus, University of Lisbon, Instituto Superior Técnico / INESC-ID** \
*2022 - 2023*
- Methodical reasoning about distributed systems problems such as the BFT consensus problem.
- Creative problem-solving used for protocol optimizations.
- Evaluation of performance and trade-offs in different system settings, including byzantine attacks.
- Supervised by **Rodrigo Rodrigues**.

**Induction of quantum behaviour in levitating nanospheres, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation** \
*2020*
- Analysis of data through the employment of quantum theory combined with control engineering.
- Research part of the TheBlinQC (Theory Blind Quantum Control) European project for exploring
the boundaries of quantum physics and gravity in experiments.
- Supervised by **Yasser Omar**.
