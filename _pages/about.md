I am a protocol protocol researcher at SSV Labs. My work focuses on the optimization and robustness of several layers of the distributed validator protocol, such as its consensus mechanism, p2p overlay network, and discovery layer. It requires a deep understanding of Ethereum's technology to which I adapt classical and state-of-the-art ideas of distributed systems.

Prior to SSV, I completed my Master's degree at the University of Lisbon, Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), supervised by [Rodrigo Rodrigues](https://www.dpss.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/). Primarily, my work was focused on the implementation and optimizations of the Alea-BFT asynchronous consensus BFT protocol to Ethereum validator networks. My main contributions were application-agnostic optimizations for the protocol, including protocol re-design and better cryptography usage, and a thorough comparison between partially synchronous and asynchronous protocol (as well as a ready-to-use code to be integrated into the SSV code base).

I have obtained two Bachelor's degrees with Honors in Mathematics, and in Computer Science and Engineering, both at the University of Lisbon, Instituto Superior Técnico (IST).
